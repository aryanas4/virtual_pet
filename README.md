Brief description: We would like to create a (visual) virtual pet (a cat) in Processing that the player can interact with in order to take care of it. There will be four moods that the player must consider: happiness, hunger, cleanliness, and sleepiness. Each level can be increased by clicking on its icon to transport you to the associated room (i.e. living room, kitchen, bathroom, bedroom) and then engaging in certain activities (i.e. playing, feeding, cleaning, putting to sleep). Over time, if the player does not tend to the pet, each mood constantly decreases slightly. There are also certain activities that can reduce these moods (i.e. hitting your pet by clicking its face decreases happiness, eating even after full decreases cleanliness, etc.).
